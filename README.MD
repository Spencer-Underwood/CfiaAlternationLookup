# CFIA Alternation Finder

A tool for CFIA staff to quickly identify "equivalent" salary positions for alternation purposes.

## The Goal
Under the Work Force Adjustment rules, if you are deemed surplus, you can try to alternate with another employee if the positions are considered **equivalent** in salary. Equivalence is defined by a maximum salary that is within **±6%** of your current position's maximum salary. 

This tool helps you find those equivalents without having to manually search through collective agreements and compare pay scales.

## How to use it
* **Find your role:** Type your classification into the search bar.
* **See equivalents:** The tool calculates your ±6% window and lists every classification that falls within that range.
* **Salary view:** The results are sorted by salary so you can see where a position sits relative to your own.
* **Reference:** A full list of all CFIA classifications (PIPSC and PSAC) is at the bottom.

## A bit about the project
I put this together using vanilla HTML and JavaScript. I used Gemini AI to help me draft the code and clean up the styling.

**Note:** This is a reference tool. Always confirm "equivalence" with HR or your union representative before proceeding with an alternation.
